# Smart Meter in London â€“ Kaggle Dataset

In this project, Smart meter on london from Kaggle Dataset was preprocessed and analysed using Python.

* Discovered temperature, UV index and dew point have an inverse correlation with energy consumption, while humidity
and cloud cover exhibit a similar trend.
* Data cleaning and pre-processing with Python, Pandas and NumPy, and visualized with matplotlib and seaborn.
* Utilizing Prophet predicted a gradual decrease in energy consumption in the future which may be attributed to factors
such as an increase in energy-efficient appliances and heightened awareness of global warming.
